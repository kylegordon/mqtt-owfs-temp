SUMMARY
=======

This script will read a list of hosts, ports and devices from /etc/mqtt-owfs-temp/devices.csv, query the devices from the relevant owserver instance, and publish the results over MQTT

INSTALL
=======

sudo apt-get install python-mosquitto git
mkdir /etc/mqtt-owfs-temp/
git clone git://github.com/kylegordon/mqtt-owfs-temp.git /usr/local/mqtt-owfs-temp/
cp /usr/local/mqtt-owfs-temp/mqtt-owfs-temp.cfg.example /etc/mqtt-owfs-temp/mqtt-owfs-temp.cfg
cp /usr/local/mqtt-owfs-temp/mqtt-owfs-temp.init /etc/init.d/mqtt-owfs-temp
update-rc.d mqtt-owfs-temp defaults
cp /usr/local/mqtt-owfs-temp/mqtt-owfs-temp.default /etc/default/mqtt-owfs-temp

/etc/init.d/mqtt-owfs-temp start

SERVER
======

If you are interested in running a 1-wire owserver instance on a Raspberry Pi, I have written a short guide here http://lodge.glasgownet.com/2012/11/14/owfs-server-on-the-raspberry-pi/
